# Legacy Git Configuration Management Approach

This is how we used to manage git configurations for ssh before adopting the new (described in the xtra README) approach.

I've moved to a more modular and maintainable method that allows for better handling of SSH configurations across different environments.

The new approach is partly documented in the [xtra README](../../README.md), and I recommend checking it out for the latest practices.

Some information is not included for privacy reasons, but the general structure and methodology can still be useful for understanding the evolution of our configuration management.

The description in the public README should be sufficient for most users to implement their own configuration. However, if you need more details or have specific questions, feel free to reach out!
