# QUICKDIRS: DEPRECATED

These are utilized by `quickdirs` in `latch.sh`

I started using `z` for adhoc directory navigation.

The `quickdirs` approach can be useful when you want to look through an index
where you will know what you want when you see it, but you don't have an identifying
string to find it at the outstart.
